# Workforce-Analytics
This project analyzes workforce data to show staff distribution by LGAs and senatorial Districts, support promotion planning, retirement and leave tracking. Using spreadsheet-based analytics, the project helps HR teams identify staff due or overdue for promotion, detect career stagnation, and plan for workforce exits.
